    <p class="story-paragraph">
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The apartment feels different today. The air is thick with silence, only occasionally disturbed by the faint sounds of the city seeping in through the open window&ndash; distant car horns, the soft clatter of a bike&rsquo;s wheels on the pavement, and the wind blowing inside. It used to smell like paint and cinnamon incense, like the promise of late-night art sessions, mismatched furniture, beautiful tapestries on the wall, and the hum of Coco&rsquo;s little feet scampering across the wooden floors. Now it&rsquo;s just&hellip; quiet. Too quiet.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There used to be splashes of color on the walls&ndash; painted canvases, some of them unfinished, some of them hidden behind the vintage mahogany TV stand. The old ferret playpen that Zoey and Maya built together still stands in the corner. Now, Coco perches inside, her unblinking eyes fixed on the room. Her tiny paws twitch, but she doesn&rsquo;t move. She&rsquo;s not as playful as she used to be, and Zoey can&rsquo;t help but wonder&ndash; maybe Coco knows too. The couch, once littered with soft blankets, now looks strangely bare. Even the pictures of them&ndash; of days filled with laughter and playful poses that hint at inside jokes&ndash; are stacked in a forgotten pile, their edges curling like something left too long in the sun. At the top, a picture of Zoey and Maya laughing in the middle of a grocery store, arms wrapped around each other, sits untouched&ndash; still vibrant, and Zoey swears she can still hear Maya&rsquo;s laugh in the air.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, the apartment feels empty, cold. A space that once felt like a warm home now feels more like a waiting room; like a void in which the clock stopped ticking, waiting for something&ndash;</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> anything&ndash; </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">to fill the silence. Zoey hovers by the doorway, fighting the rising feeling that she&rsquo;s losing everything.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya steps out of Zoey&rsquo;s apartment, her arms full with a box stacked precariously high with her things. Clothes. Books. Trinkets from her job at the vet clinic, things that used to belong to the space they built together. The box wobbles slightly as she adjusts her grip, but Maya doesn&rsquo;t notice. She&rsquo;s dressed in a loose crochet top, its earthy tones matching her sun-kissed skin. Her faded bell-bottom jeans hang comfortably on her hips, and strappy sandals peek from beneath them. Her light ginger hair falls in soft waves, a beaded necklace resting just above her collarbone, like she&rsquo;s walked right out of a dream.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey simply stands by the door, watching Maya&rsquo;s seemingly effortless beauty even now, her hand clutching the doorknob. She&rsquo;s wearing an oversized, paint-streaked shirt and yoga pants, her pink colored hair, now faded, half-heartedly swept up into a claw clip, but there&rsquo;s no comfort in the familiar clothes. This is it. Maya&rsquo;s really leaving.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey takes in a slow breath. Maya had always been the bold one. Free-spirited, chasing whatever dream she had in front of her, always moving forward. But it had always been Zoey who stayed grounded. Zoey&rsquo;s been hesitant her whole life, afraid of taking risks. But now, standing here, everything about that feels wrong. It all makes her hesitate. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should I say something? Should I just let her go?</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And then, before she knows it, the impulse hits and she's running after Maya. No plan,&nbsp; just the overwhelming feeling that she can&rsquo;t let this be it.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Maya, wait&ndash;&rdquo; Zoey calls out, her voice cracking at the edges.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya doesn&rsquo;t stop. She keeps walking, shifting the box in her arms.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&ldquo;I really can&rsquo;t do this right now, Zoey,&rdquo; Maya says, her voice flat, distant. The walls Maya builds in moments like these are almost impossible to break through.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey feels something catch in her throat, the weight of Maya&rsquo;s words settling heavy on her chest. She wants to shout, to beg, but all she can do is take a few more steps, closer to the person she thought she&rsquo;d never lose. &ldquo;I just&hellip; I don&rsquo;t get it. You&rsquo;re leaving, and we haven&rsquo;t even talked&ndash;&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya turns to face her, her expression hard. &ldquo;What else am I supposed to do? I&rsquo;ve tried, Zoey. I really have. But I can&rsquo;t just stay here forever.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey stares at Maya, mouth open, but no words come out. The silence between them feels like an ever-growing abyss&ndash; widening, deepening. She wants to say something, to stop Maya, to make her stay, but the words feel so small, so inadequate, like a kid trying to carry the weight of the world in their pockets.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as Zoey is about to speak again, the elevator doors ding, sliding open with a soft </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">whoosh</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Maya glances at the elevator, and without a word, she steps inside. As the doors begin to close, Zoey leaps in, moving almost by instinct, like two magnets drawn together despite the tension between them.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elevator lurches into motion, and the soft hum of the cables fills the space around them. Zoey stands slightly to the side, her right arm over her chest in the old way she always did when she felt vulnerable. Her left hand absently fiddles with her septum ring&ndash; she&rsquo;s been doing that since she was a teenager, trying to calm herself when things get tough. But this feels different. Nothing feels calming anymore.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya leans against the opposite side, her gaze fixed on the changing floor numbers over the elevator door, her fingers tapping idly on the box she still holds. Zoey glances at her&ndash;&nbsp; tries not to&ndash; but she can&rsquo;t help it. Maya&rsquo;s posture is perfect, like nothing affects her, but Zoey knows better. Maya&rsquo;s always been like this, pretending everything&rsquo;s fine even when her world is falling apart.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ding - 10</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ding - 9</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ding - 8</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elevator glides down, each chime marking the passing floors, counting down the distance between them and the lobby waiting below. The air between them is thick, heavy with everything unsaid, everything they&rsquo;re afraid to confront. Zoey steals a glance at Maya again, and this time, Maya doesn&rsquo;t look away.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ding - 7</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ding - 6</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, the elevator shudders. The hum that had been so constant dies out for a second, replaced by a harsh squeal of metal against metal. Zoey gasps, and Maya grips the box tighter, her body going stiff as the lights flicker overhead. A brief, jarring shake. Then... nothing.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elevator comes to an abrupt stop.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a moment, they stand in the dimming light, the air heavy with their confessions and the world outside. Neither of them says anything. Neither of them moves.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a moment, Maya speaks, her voice light and casual, in a way that felt almost too sarcastic. &ldquo;Well, I guess the universe really wants us to talk, huh?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey exhales sharply, pressing the emergency button. Nothing happens. She presses it again. Then again.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya tilts her head. &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s broken.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey swallows. &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya smirks, shifting the box in her arms. &ldquo;You okay? You look kinda pale.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; Zoey says quickly, even though her pulse is suddenly in her throat.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">this </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">wasn&rsquo;t part of the plan. She was supposed to&ndash; what? Stop Maya before she left? Say something cheesy that they&rsquo;d hear in the Hallmark movies they used to watch every Christmas? She had no idea. And she certainly didn&rsquo;t expect to get stuck with her, to be locked in a tiny space where she couldn&rsquo;t just leave if things got too hard.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya doesn&rsquo;t respond right away. Instead, she sets her box down, stretching her arms with a groan. &ldquo;Well, we might be here a while.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey forces a tight smile. &ldquo;Great. Just perfect.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">She backs into the corner, arms crossing, trying to ignore the way her stomach twists.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The silence stretches between them, thick and uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">She can hear the quiet tapping of Maya&rsquo;s fingers against the metal handrail, the faint crackle of the ancient speaker system overhead as she runs her fingers through her own faded pink hair.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;It reminds her of another time, a happier memory.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was almost a year ago, and Zoey sat cross-legged on a kitchen stool, her hands coated in faded pink dye as she twisted her hair up in a makeshift bun. &ldquo;I swear, if I end up looking like a strawberry milkshake, I&rsquo;m blaming you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya, standing behind her, grinned as she massaged the dye into Zoey&rsquo;s hair. &ldquo;You already look like one.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey swatted at her, missing by an inch. &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t even make sense. But still, rude.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya only chuckled, her fingers grazing the nape of Zoey&rsquo;s neck, sending a shiver down her spine. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s cute,&rdquo; Maya murmured, her voice softer now, more careful.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey&rsquo;s breath hitched. She didn&rsquo;t turn around. She didn&rsquo;t know if she could. &ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya&rsquo;s hands stilled in her hair. &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The air shifted. Zoey could feel it&ndash; could feel the weight of something unspoken pressing between them. But she didn&rsquo;t say anything. She just let the moment hang there, let Maya&rsquo;s fingers linger against her skin.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe if she didn&rsquo;t move, if she didn&rsquo;t speak, she could stay in this moment forever.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey shifts against the cold wall, shaking the memory away. That was then. This is now.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya clears her throat, and Zoey realizes she&rsquo;s been staring.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo; Maya asks, cocking her head.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey blinks. Looks away. &ldquo;Yeah. Just&hellip; thinking.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya hums. &ldquo;Dangerous pastime.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey huffs, but it lacks any real heat. Instead, she lets her gaze drift away to Maya&rsquo;s box. Their past, stacked inside cardboard edges.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;&hellip;What are you taking with you?&rdquo; she asks before she can stop herself.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya glances at the box, like she&rsquo;s only just remembering it&rsquo;s there. She hesitates, then reaches over, pulling something from the top.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A small, ceramic fox figurine, with a cute raccoon on top of its head.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey&rsquo;s breath catches. &ldquo;You still have that?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya turns the fox over in her hands, running her thumb over the tiny painted details. &ldquo;Of course I do,&rdquo; she murmurs. &ldquo;You gave it to me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Zo, come look at this,&rdquo; Maya called, grinning as she pointed at the shelf of the dusty thrift store. It had been their way of celebrating their first anniversary.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey peered over her shoulder. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tiny fox with a raccoon on its head.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Yeah, and?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey raised a brow. &ldquo;And&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya huffed, grabbing the figurine and holding it up dramatically. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s us.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey snorted. &ldquo;Maya, it&rsquo;s literally just a fox and a raccoon.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya clutched her chest. &ldquo;Wow. I can&rsquo;t believe you don&rsquo;t see it.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey shook her head, smiling. &ldquo;Alright, explain it to me then.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya held the fox up between them, her expression suddenly serious. &ldquo;See, they&rsquo;re small. Scrappy. But they&rsquo;re still happy. Plus, they&rsquo;re cute.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey rolled her eyes. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re ridiculous.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But later that day, Zoey went back and bought it anyway.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">She wrapped it in old newspaper, left it on Maya&rsquo;s nightstand with a sticky note that just said:</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fine. You win. But you&rsquo;re the fox.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey watches as Maya turns the little fox in her hands, eyes distant.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">She wants to say something&ndash; wants to ask why Maya kept it, why she didn&rsquo;t leave it behind like every other reminder of their relationship.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the words catch in her throat.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, Maya exhales, setting the fox back inside the box. &ldquo;Not everything has to go,&rdquo; she says, almost to herself.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey swallows hard, feeling the weight of those words settle deep in her chest.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elevator stays still around them, trapping them in the moment.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey can&rsquo;t stop thinking about the fox. The tiny thing shouldn&rsquo;t matter, not when Maya had left everything else behind. But it does. Of course it does.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before she can stop herself, the words come spilling out:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want to leave, then why are you?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya exhales sharply. She leans her head against the metal wall, eyes flicking up toward the ceiling like she&rsquo;s searching for patience. Or an escape.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not just a sigh. It&rsquo;s a warning.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey grips her arms, digging her nails into her skin. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t get it. You kept that stupid little fox, but you&rsquo;re choosing to walk away from everything else. What am I supposed to do with that?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya&rsquo;s jaw tightens. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Zoey. Maybe stop obsessing over a damn ceramic fox?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey lets out a hollow laugh, shaking her head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about the fox.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Then what is it about?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey stares at her. The words are right there on her tongue.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s about you. About us. About the fact that I still wake up and reach for you before I remember you&rsquo;re gone.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But she swallows them down.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elevator suddenly creaks.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sound is low, almost like a growl of metal on metal.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then&ndash;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The air conditioning shuts off with a click.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A heavy, suffocating stillness settles over them.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Californian heat sets in immediately. The walls feel closer. The air is thicker.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey shifts. Rolls her shoulders. Runs a hand over the back of her neck, tugging on the pink strands.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s too warm. It&rsquo;s&hellip; Familiar.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her breath hitches. And just like that, she&rsquo;s back there.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The apartment is too hot.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The little fan by the window does nothing. The smell of cinnamon lingers in the air, but it doesn&rsquo;t feel comforting. Not tonight.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey sits on the couch, arms wrapped around herself. Trying to stay small.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya paces in front of her, running a hand through her hair, her bracelets clinking together with every movement.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do this anymore.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey&rsquo;s stomach drops.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her voice is quiet, unsure. &ldquo;&hellip;Do what?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya runs a hand over her face, dragging her features with the force of her hand as she tries to convey her thoughts. &ldquo;This&hellip;&rdquo; Maya shakes her head, frustration heavy in her voice. &ldquo;This waiting. Waiting for something to change, for you to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">actually </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">try. For you to take a chance, Zoey. I&rsquo;m tired of waiting for you to decide that we&rsquo;re worth fighting for.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey&rsquo;s heart races. She wants to argue, but the words catch in her throat.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Maya, I&ndash;&rdquo; she starts.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Maya&rsquo;s voice sharpens, cutting Zoey off. &ldquo;Let me talk.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey presses her lips together, biting back the defense she wants to throw up.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya steps closer, her eyes flashing. &ldquo;I saw the email. The </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ghebaly </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gallery&ndash; they want you, that&rsquo;s huge! And you turned it down. Why? Because you&rsquo;re too scared to try, because you can&rsquo;t take the jump.&rdquo; She throws up her hands, as if that&rsquo;s all she needs to say. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t even take a chance on your own damn talent! </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why, Zoey</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey flinches but doesn&rsquo;t look away. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not fair, I-I didn&rsquo;t turn it down. I just&hellip; I wasn&rsquo;t ready.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya&rsquo;s laugh is short, incredulous. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fair? You&rsquo;re the one who shuts down every time I try to talk about the future. Every time I try to dream with you, you just&ndash;you act like I&rsquo;m asking for the impossible! And it&rsquo;s the same with your art!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey grips her own arms tighter. &ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t have the luxury of just throwing myself into things without thinking, Maya! You do. You always have.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya&rsquo;s eyes flash. &ldquo;</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">God</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you act like I&rsquo;m reckless! Like I don&rsquo;t think things through, but maybe I just trust that things can work out if we fight for them. If we </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">really </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">fucking try.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey shakes her head, her voice rising. &ldquo;And maybe I don&rsquo;t have that trust! Maybe I can&rsquo;t afford to believe in some perfect, happy ending like you do!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya&rsquo;s hands clench at her sides. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the problem, Zoey! It&rsquo;s not about a perfect ending&ndash; it&rsquo;s about fighting for something instead of sitting and hoping things will just magically work out!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey stands abruptly, her breath shallow. &ldquo;You think I don&rsquo;t know that? You think I don&rsquo;t wish I could just jump and hope I&rsquo;ll land on my feet?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya&rsquo;s voice cracks. &ldquo;Then why won&rsquo;t you? Why is everything with you just&ndash; just waiting? Waiting for the right time, the right moment&ndash; like life is gonna hand you a fucking guarantee?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey&rsquo;s eyes burn. &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m scared, Maya!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The words hang in the air, thick and heavy between them.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey&rsquo;s hands shake. Her voice drops, but it doesn&rsquo;t lose its edge. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared of failing. I&rsquo;m scared of losing you. And it&rsquo;s like no matter what I do, no matter how hard I try&ndash;&rdquo; She swallows hard. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s never enough.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya&rsquo;s expression shifts for just a second. A flicker of hurt. But it doesn&rsquo;t stop her.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her next words come quieter, but they hit harder. &ldquo;&hellip;Maybe it isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey freezes.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya exhales, shaking her head. When she speaks again, her voice is raw. &ldquo;Zoey, I can&rsquo;t keep doing this. I need someone who&rsquo;s willing to move forward with me, someone who will always choose a future with me. Someone who doesn&rsquo;t just sit there waiting for everything to be perfect.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey&rsquo;s chest tightens. &ldquo;I </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">have </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">chosen you, Maya.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya&rsquo;s expression shifts, searching her face for some kind of truth. &ldquo;Then why does it always feel like I&rsquo;m the only one fighting for us?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey has no answer.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya exhales, her voice breaking as she speaks again, softer now, but with an edge of finality. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t keep begging you to choose me. I need someone who isn&rsquo;t afraid to fight. For us. For their passions. For something real.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The silence stretches. Zoey wants to say something, to explain, but the words catch in her throat.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Maya shakes her head, her expression hardening. &ldquo;Zoey, you&rsquo;re not enough for yourself. How am I supposed to be enough for both of us?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something snaps inside Zoey.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fear, the hurt, the anger&ndash; she can&rsquo;t hold it in anymore.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; The word is sharp, brittle, breaking. &ldquo;If you wanna go so bad, then just go.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya&rsquo;s breath catches.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For just a second&ndash; just a second&ndash; Zoey sees something flicker in her eyes. A hesitation. A sliver of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">don&rsquo;t make me do this</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then it&rsquo;s gone.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya nods, her face hardening into resolve. She grabs her keys and walks to the door.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">She doesn&rsquo;t look back.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The door clicks shut.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Zoey is left in the unbearable silence, too hot, too suffocated, too alone.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A loud creak yanks Zoey out of it.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elevator is still too hot.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">She&rsquo;s breathing too fast. The walls are too close.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">She clenches her fists, tries to steady herself, but she feels it creeping in&ndash; the same tightness in her chest, the same feeling from that night.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then&ndash;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;&hellip;Zo?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey blinks. Looks for Maya on the opposite corner of the elevator.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya is watching her, eyes softer now, brows drawn together in concern.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey swallows and looks away. &ldquo;&hellip; It&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But they both know it&rsquo;s not nothing.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the elevator continues its painful stillness, Zoey glances at Maya again, unsure of how to bridge the gap between them. The familiar feeling of suffocation builds in her chest, the warmth of the air pressing against her skin. She fidgets with her septum ring again, a small, anxious habit she can&rsquo;t shake. She&rsquo;s so used to being stuck, to waiting for the right time. But here, in the confined space with Maya, it feels different. The universe, or whatever forces might be out there, isn&rsquo;t giving them time to wait anymore.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hum of the elevator returns, faint and almost unnoticed, but it doesn&rsquo;t mask the tension. Zoey opens her mouth, then closes it again, unsure of what to say. It feels like everything she says could break them further. She&rsquo;s not ready for that.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then she feels it. A soft, warm pressure around her pinkie finger. Zoey looks down, surprised to find Maya&rsquo;s hand extending toward hers. Slowly, carefully, Maya links their pinkies together, her fingers warm against Zoey&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s small, but it feels grounding, like something that might keep them from drifting further apart. For a moment, neither of them speaks. The weight of their past, the frustration, the unspoken feelings, they all linger between them, but the gesture is enough to placate them. Zoey exhales a shaky breath, her pulse slowing just a little.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya looks up at her then, her eyes soft, but with something more than just resignation. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not perfect, Zo. You know that, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoey nods, swallowing hard. Her throat is tight, but she manages, &ldquo;Yeah. I do.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya&rsquo;s voice is quieter now, more tentative. &ldquo;But&hellip; maybe we could try again. Not like before, but&hellip; with more of us in it. All of us.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The weight of those words settles between them, and for the first time in a long while, Zoey feels the flicker of something that could be hope.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They both jump as the elevator lurches into motion again. The sudden movement is jarring, but it feels like a sign. The elevator begins its descent again, the familiar ding of the floors echoing as they approach the lobby.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ding - 5</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ding - 4</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ding - 3</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ding - 2</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ding - 1</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the elevator doors finally open to the lobby, Zoey steps out first, her hand still linked with Maya&rsquo;s. The air feels cooler here, like a breath after the suffocating heat. Maya follows close behind, her steps hesitant but not as heavy as before.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A comfortable silence hangs between them as they walk toward the doors of the building, the noise of the city waiting just outside. When they reach the exit, Zoey hesitates, then looks over at Maya, her voice quiet but steady. &ldquo;Do you want to grab a coffee?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya smiles, a little unsure, but with a glimmer of something familiar in her eyes. &ldquo;Yeah. I&rsquo;d like that.&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span></p>
