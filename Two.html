	  <p class="story-paragraph"> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cool night stretched out endlessly, the empty road briefly disturbed by the soft hum coming from a maroon Honda Accord and the warm glow of its headlights. The road twisted through the small hills, framed by occasional patches of trees and tall grass, with rocky mountains in the distance. Their outline was barely visible in the night, with only their rough peaks faintly illuminated by the moonlight. The radio crackled with static before settling into a low, droning talk show about urban legends. Melissa exhaled a slow stream of vapour, watching as it curled in the dim interior of her car. The vape pen clicked as she set it down on one of the cup holders, right next to her forgotten, lukewarm Americano. She then gave a quick glance to the GPS on her phone, hoisted on a black mount in the dashboard.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two more hours.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She saw the girl seemingly pop out of nowhere&ndash; just a shadow at first, standing on the shoulder of the road, one hand raised in a hesitant wave. A few feet away, an old, beat-up sedan sat at an awkward angle, hazard lights blinking weakly in the darkness of the night. Melissa barely had time to consider it before instinct took over, her foot easing off the gas. A girl alone in the middle of nowhere? It was reckless, but she couldn&rsquo;t just leave her out here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The passenger door creaked as the girl climbed in, settling into the seat with a quiet sigh. The fuzzy overhead light barely illuminated her face. Young, in her mid-twenties at most, with pale skin and dark hair that hung in damp strands around her face. Her clothes looked slightly unkempt, like she had been traveling for a while.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; the girl murmured, pulling the seatbelt across her chest. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t sure anyone would stop.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melissa glanced at her briefly before focusing back on the road. &ldquo;Yeah, well. Middle of nowhere at this hour? Thought you might need help.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl hummed in acknowledgement. A silence stretched between them, thin and fragile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I like your car,&rdquo; the girl commented softly, breaking the silence.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melissa almost laughed. Out of all things, that&rsquo;s what she picked? &ldquo;Thanks. It&rsquo;s not much, but it gets me places.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl traced a finger along the dashboard, her nails lightly tapping against the plastic. Her nails were rough, uneven, and bitten down. A nervous habit, perhaps. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cozy,&rdquo; she said after a beat. &ldquo;Not a lot of people still drive cars like this one. Feels kinda personal, you know? Like it says something about you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melissa smirked, keeping her eyes on the road. &ldquo;And what does it say about me?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl shrugged, her gaze trailing over the worn leather of the center console. &ldquo;You like things that last. Reliable things.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melissa huffed a quiet laugh. &ldquo;Guess that&rsquo;s one way to put it.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl continued to idly trace circles in the faded plastic. &ldquo;You drive this road often?&rdquo; she asked, tilting her head slightly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melissa nodded. &ldquo;Yeah. Work keeps me moving around a lot. Long drives, late nights. You get used to it.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Sounds kinda lonely,&rdquo; the girl mused, glancing out the window at the continuous dark, the outline of distant mountains barely visible under the night sky.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melissa let out a soft breath. &ldquo;Sometimes. But I don&rsquo;t mind the quiet. Gives me time to think.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She didn&rsquo;t say what she had really been thinking about. How, before she left for this trip, she had found another note&ndash; this one tucked carefully under her doormat. No signature, no explanation, just a single sentence in neat, cursive handwriting:</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">You&rsquo;re always on the road. I wonder where you&rsquo;ll go next.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had stared at it for a long time, the edges crumpling slightly under her tight grip. The gifts had been bad enough. The first few, she had tried to dismiss. Roses on the porch, a book she had mentioned once in an article. But the notes had started recently. Too direct. Too specific.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melissa had shoved the latest one into a drawer and told herself she was overreacting. After all, it wasn&rsquo;t like she had proof someone was stalking her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl hummed again, then turned back to her. &ldquo;So, what do you do?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melissa took a sip of her stale coffee, grimacing slightly at the taste. &ldquo;Freelance journalism. Mostly small stories&hellip; opinion pieces, travel guides, that kind of thing.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s cool. Bet you see a lot of interesting places.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melissa shrugged. &ldquo;Some. But honestly, a lot of gas stations and cheap motels. Not as glamorous as it sounds.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl chuckled softly. &ldquo;Still better than being stuck in one place.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Guess so,&rdquo; Melissa answered with a light smile. &ldquo;So, was that your car back there? The one with the hazard lights on?&rdquo; she asked, wanting to know more about the stranger she had allowed into her car.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl shifted, pulling her jacket tighter around herself. &ldquo;I was supposed to be at the Glenwood Resort in the city. Had a room booked and everything. But the stupid car broke down and the towing people said they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to help me until tomorrow morning.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melissa considered the name of the resort for a second. &ldquo;Glenwood Resort? The one on Main Street?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;You know it?&rdquo; The girl tilted her head slightly, watching Melissa in the dim glow of the GPS displayed on the phone. Then, she spoke again, voice light and almost playful, if it wasn&rsquo;t for the rehearsed tone in her words. &ldquo;Wait, don&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;re headed there too!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melissa nodded with a smile, amused by the coincidence. &ldquo;Actually, yeah. I'm attending an event there for an article. A small convention. Should be interesting.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl&rsquo;s lips curled into a slow, knowing smile. &ldquo;Really? What kind of convention?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Some collector&rsquo;s expo. Vintage memorabilia, rare finds, that sort of geeky thing.&rdquo; Melissa shrugged. &ldquo;Not exactly front-page news, but people online seem to love this kind of stuff.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl nodded, a fascinated look in her eyes. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s cool. You must meet a lot of different people.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Yeah, part of the job.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl was silent for a moment, then glanced at Melissa with something unreadable in her eyes. &ldquo;Do you ever run into the same person over and over? In your press trips, I mean.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melissa raised a brow. &ldquo;I guess? I stay local so I might run into familiar faces every now and then when covering an event. Why?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl&rsquo;s smile slightly widened, almost imperceptibly. &ldquo;Just curious. It&rsquo;s funny how complete strangers can cross paths over and over. Sometimes it almost feels&hellip; intentional.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melissa chuckled, shaking her head. &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s just bound to happen occasionally. The world&rsquo;s smaller than we think. Especially in a state like Colorado.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl didn&rsquo;t respond right away. Instead, she turned her gaze back to the window, watching the road stretch as far as the headlights could reach. &ldquo;Yeah. Maybe.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melissa kept her eyes focused ahead, and her fingers flexed slightly around the wheel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl sighed, &ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s easy to miss the signs sometimes,&rdquo; she murmured.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melissa frowned. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl&rsquo;s hand tugged on a loose thread on her jeans one last time before letting her right hand rest on the door panel&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she said lightly. &ldquo;Just thinking out loud.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melissa let the words settle while the radio continued to chatter in hushed whispers, her grip tightening slightly around the wheel. Something about the girl&rsquo;s tone made her uneasy, like she knew more than she was letting on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She forced herself to shrug it off. Just late-night paranoia, she reasoned. She had picked up a stranded person. That was all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;So&hellip; are you from around here?&rdquo; Melissa asked, glancing at the girl out of the corner of her eye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl smiled, slow and knowing. &ldquo;Something like that.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melissa waited for her to elaborate, but she didn&rsquo;t. Instead, the girl reached for the air vent, adjusting it with a hint of familiarity. Her fingers were pale in the faint glow of the dashboard lights, and for the first time, Melissa noticed something odd&ndash; A silver ring with a delicate twisting design, like vines curling around the slender finger. She knew that ring, she had seen an identical copy a few days ago, sitting inside a small velvet box on her porch, right next to a neatly folded note:</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought this would suit you.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A shiver crept up her spine but she exhaled slowly and shook off the thought. It was just another coincidence. &ldquo;Well, at least you won&rsquo;t be stranded all night. Glenwood isn&rsquo;t too far now.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl nodded. &ldquo;Yeah. That&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another stretch of silence. Outside, the road remained a vast, empty black, the dark concrete ahead almost invisible in the night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then the girl spoke again, her voice softer this time. &ldquo;Hey, Melissa?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melissa blinked in surprise, and her stomach dropped. Her pulse thumped in her ears, each beat a hammer blow against her chest. She forced a laugh, voice measured and slightly tremulous. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember giving you my name.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl smiled, tilting her head slightly as her eyes caught the faint glow of the dashboard lights. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melissa kept her eyes locked on the road, willing her voice to sound steadier than it felt. &ldquo;No. I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A pause hung in the air, thick and suffocating. The car&rsquo;s tires whispered against the concrete, the only sound outside of the radio&rsquo;s quiet chatter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl exhaled, as if amused by her own slip-up. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny. I could&rsquo;ve sworn you did.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melissa&rsquo;s mind raced. Was this some kind of lapse in her memory? Had she mentioned her name earlier without realizing? Or maybe it was just a prank? She glanced at the girl again, her skin prickling. The girl sat still, her dark hair hanging in long strands around her face, her expression unreadable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, finally, the girl spoke, her voice quiet but certain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Like I said,&rdquo; Her fingers tapped lightly against the door panel, slow and deliberate. &ldquo;Some paths cross more often than you realize.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melissa's breath hitched.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The highway stretched ahead, empty and endless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And suddenly, two hours felt like a very, very long time.</span></p>
